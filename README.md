# QGIS_NA_2020_SLYR
Presentation Outline Public Draft

# Proposed Talk
In this session, I would like to cover an introduction to SLYR, North Road, Nyall Dawson, and background on the tool.  
I would also like to provide examples of conversions from proprietary ESRI projects and styles to QGIS projects and styles.  
In addition, I would like to talk about how this tool can benefit those in mixed GIS environments, those who wish to transition to FOSS, or those consuming many government-provided data often found in these formats.  
Other tips, tricks, and future developments will likely be covered as well.  
I will be working with Nyall Dawson on the content and scope, so this is my best projection as of now.  
I will provide updates if it changes.

# Requested Talking Points
*Kurt Meneke*  
I think the sheer number of symbology and layout features/improvements that have been developed as a result of SLYR is interesting, and worth a mention.
